Automatic Headline Generation
=============================

Prerequisites
-------------

ROUGE depends on the XML::DOM perl module. On Ubuntu, install it using 

$ sudo apt-get install libxml-dom-perl

This project uses the Maven build system. On Ubuntu, install it using

$ sudo apt-get install maven

Dataset
-------

The DUC 2004 dataset may not be bundled with this. Ensure that it is located
in the duc2004 folder. That is, the directory structure should look as follows:

pom.xml
eval
[...]
duc2004
 - docs
 - eval
   - models
   - peers

Usage
-----

Run the eval script to generate the headlines for all 500 DUC 2004 documents.
It computes and outputs the ROUGE score at the end.

$ ./eval

Annotation Cache
----------------

Note that this distribution may not come with the cached annotations. Thus,
the initial run may take a long time (about an hour). Any subsequent runs
will only take 15 to 30 seconds.
